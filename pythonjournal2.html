<h2>The Numbers of Python</h2>

<p>In the last page, I covered the data-types of Python. One of these data-types are called 'Numeric types'. There are 3 numeric types in Python.</p>


<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
<ul>
	<li>int</li>
	<li>float</li>
	<li>complex</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
<ul style="list-style: none;">
	<li>x = 1 (int)</li>
	<li>y = 2.8 (float)</li>
	<li>x = 1j (complex)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<br>

<p>Given this, variables of their respected numeric types are then created once a value is assigned to them. So, for example - if I were to create a variable, keelan = 5, then that variable would be then classified as an <em>'int'</em> numeric type. Whereas, if I were to make a variable, keelan = 3.5, then the variable would be classified as a<em>'float'</em> numeric type. And with the variable keelan = 5b, it would be classified as a <em>'complex'</em> numeric type.</p>


<p>To verify a specified type of any object within the Python language, write the '<em>type()</em>' function. This function provides the definition of what each variable is classified as, when <em>print (type (keelan) )</em> is written. <br> Given the variable is 'keelan', whatever numeric value is assigned after, the function will tell me what type of numeric the variable is - being an int, float or complex.</p>

<br>

<h3>Int</h3>

<p>Int, stands for interger. This is a whole number, positive or negative. Int has no decimals involved, and has an unlimited length.</p>

<p>Examples of Int (intergers):</p>

<ul style="list-style: none;">
	
	<li>x = 1</li>
	<li>y = 2565222554887771 (this works as long as they're whole numbers.)</li>
	<li>z = -3522771 (as above, is below here. An 'int' numeric type can be a long list of negative numbers, so long as they're whole numbers.</li>
	
	<br>
	
	<li>Don't forget the function: <em>print (type (x))</em></li>

</ul>


<h3>Float</h3>

<p>Float is basically a fancy way of saying a number with a decimal. Float stands for "floating point number", and is classified as a positive or negative number containing one, or more decimals.</p>
<p>Within the Float type, we can place an 'e' beside the number. This will define it's power, say, if we wanted to square a number. <strong>E.g.)</strong> x = 8e2, or y = 12E4, even z = -87.7e100.</p>

<p>Examples of Floats:</p>

<ul style="list-style: none;">
	<li>x = 1.15</li>
	<li>y = 1.30</li>
	<li>z = -25.59</li>
	<br>
	<li>Using the function <em>print (type (x))</em>, the console/terminal will display what this variable is classified as a numeric type.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Complex</h3>
<p>The numeric type known as 'Complex', simply means that, any number assigned to a variable with the letter J beside it. <strong>E.g.)</strong> x = 3+5j. The variable has a 'j' beside a number. The 'j', means an imaginary value. Anytime there is the letter 'j' beside a number within a variable, it will be recongized as a complex numeric type.</p>

<h3>Type Conversion</h3>
<p>Within the Python Language, we can convert from one numeric data type, to another. To do so, type: <em>int(), float(), or complex()</em>. Say, if a variable (x = 1), which would be an int, we could convert that into a float, by typing <em>a = float(x)</em>. </p>

<p>More examples of conversion:</p>

<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>x = 1 # int </li>	
<li>y = 2.8 # float </li>
<li>z = 1j # complex</li>

<br>

<li>#convert from int - float: a = float(x)</li>
<li>#convert from float - int: b = int(y)</li>
<li>#convert from int - complex: c = complex(x)</li>
<br>
<li>Complex cannot be converted into anything - however, int and float can be converted into complex.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Random Number</h3>
<p>I can also generate random numbers in the Python Programming Language. There is no function, such as 'random()', like there is with other functions. So, to make a random number, we use the built in module called 'random'.</p>
<p>To use the module 'random', we import it. Meaning, we type:</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
	<li>1.) import random</li>
    <li>2.) print (random.randrange(1,10) #The 'rand' stands for random. This can also be between 5-10, 1-100, or 9-1000, for example.</li>
</ul>
